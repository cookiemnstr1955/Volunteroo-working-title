Volunteeroo (working title) is all-in-one platform aimed to ease the pain of recruiting, onboarding and managing volunteers for the events.

It helps the most important user - Event Manager. Puts in one's hands the capability to create events, put on onboarding process that volunteers should follow to be selected for the event, manage the volunteers on the event's day via the platform. Volunteers can be assessed after events with rating or blacklisted if the was innapropriate actions/behavior.

The platform as a whole
— cms dashboard of all upcoming events that require volunteers, with key insights (how many volunteers, for what, what qualifications etc)
— database of successful and blacklisted volunteers
— database of default courses useful for all events

Key functionality for:
— volunteer applications
— volunteer screening (asynchronous video interviews) 
— volunteer training: 
a) default courses (first aid, emergency codes, inclusivity etc)
b) custom courses created by event organizers (text, video, quiz etc.)
— on day of event
a) event agenda
b) volunteer schedule (with notifications)
c) who volunteer reports to
d) zone of responsibility

f) dos and don’ts list

— end of event

b) volunteer gains karma on their profile, allowing to be easily selected as a top candidate in future events
c) if volunteer is unsuccessful they lose karma and don’t get certificate

Growth potential
Use non-profits as a way to collect database of good volunteers that can be accessed through a premium subscription by corporate clients for high end (forex, tech) events

Example Use case for random event:

I Preparation:
0. There is an event coming. It will hold n-hundred people and the event manager needs volunteers to work on the day of the event. The actions expected from volunteers are not difficult, but actions should be precise and not causing any fuss seen by the event visitors.
1. Event manager (EM) logs in to Volunteroo and creates a new event.
2. EM creates an onboarding flow a.k.a Education process via following but not limited forms: questionnaire, traning materials of any media format, online meeting, online interview
3. EM creates a checklist of DOs and DONTs on the event, event map with areas of responsibilities per role, assigns each volunteer a role and puts a team leader (if needed)

II Volunteer onboarding:
1. Want-to-be-volunteer (WV) joins the platform.
2. WV is interested in the event created by EM (either the event was found by WV by browsing platform or by attracting WV by EM via various media channels)
3. WV enrolls to the event.
4. At the same time WV gets access to the onboarding materials required to participate in the event.
5. WV passess the onboarding workflow and reaches interview stage
6. EM interviews the WV and makes final decision to approve the WV and volunteer (V) for the event
7. EM shares the event with V with details of event day

III Event day:
1. V gets to the event venue, follows the EM's directions provided in event details inside Volunteroo platform
2. V communicates with EM and other Vs using the designated way of communication - any available messenger (WhatsApp, Viber, Telegram etc)
3. EM uses the platform to manage volunteers via sending notifications on next event act, unforseen problems, gives orders, or even asks to change role targeting exact Vs
4. V does a perfect volunteer job and event sucessfully passed
5. EM has all history of interactions with the volunteers

IV Post event actions:
1. EM reviews the Vs performance during event
2. For successful Vs EM issues a certificate of successful volunteering
3*. For unsuccessful Vs EM does not issue a certificate and may blacklist the volunteer for violations
